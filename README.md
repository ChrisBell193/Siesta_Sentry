# ðŸ“š Siesta Sentry

Have you ever been in a situation where you're driving at night, the darkness outside, and you start to feel that drowsiness creeping in? Your eyelids become heavy, and you find yourself nodding off, a potentially perilous situation when behind the wheel. Or perhaps, in today's world of online classes, you've struggled to stay awake during a lecture, fearing you might miss crucial information. What if there was a product that could automatically detect these moments of drowsiness or danger and provide a wake-up call? That's precisely what Siesta Sentry aims to achieve.
